# Rock-paper-scissor

"Rock, paper, scissors" is a simple and popular game in which two players choose between three
options: rock (represented by a closed fist), paper (represented by an open hand), and scissors 
(represented by two extended fingers). Each option beats one option and loses to another, and the
objective of the game is to choose the winning option to defeat the opponent. For example, rock beats scissors, 
scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
